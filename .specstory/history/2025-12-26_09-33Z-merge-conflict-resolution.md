**Providing concise conflict resolution steps**

To resolve the conflicts: in the tsconfig file, accept the changes that exclude unwanted paths as appropriate; for package.json, confirm the deletion if intentional; and for extension.ts, confirm its removal is correct. After resolving these, save the files and complete the merge.</details></think>

Here’s how to resolve the three conflict files and the 7 conflict markers quickly:

1) `tsconfig.json`
- Keep the main branch’s exclude list: `["node_modules", "dist"]`.
- Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
- Resulting tail should be:
  - `"include": ["src/**/*.ts"],`
  - `"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]`
  - closing brace.

2) `package.json`
- File is deleted on main. If you intend to keep the extension package, restore it; otherwise, accept deletion.
- Given the diff, to match main, delete `package.json` (remove conflict markers if present and ensure file is absent).

3) `src/extension.ts`
- File was removed on main. Decide whether to keep the extension code.
- To match main, delete the file (or remove its contents). If you keep it, remove markers and ensure code is valid/compiled.

General quick steps (PowerShell):
- Open each conflicted file, remove all `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`.
- For files intended to be deleted: `Remove-Item package.json src/extension.ts` (only if you choose main’s deletion).
- Re-run formatting/lint if applicable.
- Verify no conflicts remain: `git status` → ensure “both modified” cleared.
- Run tests that cover the observability additions (e.g., `pytest tests/m5_observability/edge` or TS build if keeping extension).
